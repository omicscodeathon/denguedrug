# Unprocessed ligand database

The DENV2 database was obtained from PubChem [(BioAssay ID: 651640)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/651640)

# Description

A high throughput screen (HTS) measured in Cell-Based and Microorganism Combination System Using Plate Reader of 343,305 compound library to identify inhibitors of Dengue Virus was pooled from PubChem bioassay AID: 651640. Specifically aimed to identify inhibitors of Dengue virus, the BHK-21 cells were treated with various compounds before being infected with Dengue virus serotype 2. The expected outcome was that compounds resulting in an increase in ATP levels, indicating increased cell viability compared to both the positive control (uninfected cells) and the neutral control were considered as positives. The Bioassay data contains 5946 actives and 321,638 inactives.
