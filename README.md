Deep Learning and Molecular Docking Prediction of Potential Inhibitors against Dengue Virus

## Overview 
In this project we are building a in silico pipeline to identify novel dengue virus inhibitors. We will be incorporating Deep/Machine Learning (DL/ML) and molecular modeling techniques into the pipeline.

Please cite and [star](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) the repository if you utilise the pipeline for research or commercial purposes

## Objectives
- [ ] Identfiy dengue virus protein target.
- [ ] Identify dengue virus ligand database for DL/ML training and molecular modeling method validation.
- [ ] Determine DL/ML algorithm to be utilised in project.
- [ ] Process ligand database and train DL/ML model.
- [ ] Evaluate DL/ML performance.
- [ ] Validate molecular modeling method using prepared ligand database (Actives vs non-actives)
